V1.90 RELEASE
- Support for animated (height)maps! They are defined in the "Map Sequences"-window in the Prefs-section
  and saved as local properties, i.e. you may use them independly of a specific set of fractal params.
   - You define an image sequence by filename, start frame, end frame, loop setting and frame increment
   - You assign this sequence to a logical map channel (any number) you wish
   - You use this channel as map number in your fractal, e.g. as color map or heightmap
   - Now you can preview the state at frame [n] by changing the frame number in the main view
     (this is just for test render, not for animating)
   - When you use this fractal in the animation window, the map will now be animated, i.e. at each frame
     of the animation the corresponding frame of the map will be calculated (accordingly to the settings
     you made) and the image-file will be loaded. If no image file is found it is asumed to be "black".

- new MutaGen-module to easily explore new combinations of formulas and settings
   - four types of mutations:
       - add, remove, exchange formulas
       - modify params of formulas
       - modify Julia-mode
       - modify iteration count
   - in the UI you may turn on/off those types individually, by specifying a weight, and you may specify an additional
     strength-parameter
   - you may browse through the already generated generations of mutations and restart on interesting results
   - you may resize the window to alter the size of the generated thumbnail images
   - you may cancel/restart the mutation-process at any time (sometimes there occur combinations of parameters
     which may lead to "endless" calculations, in such cases it is helpful to be able to just restart)
   - WARNING: some formula-combinations may SILENTLY crash the program, so please save often!
     Silently crashing means you will not see it immediately, often the UI starts to behave weird.
     We are working to improve this!
   - This is just the first version, e.g. interpolated functions are not supported yet!
   - Please note, that it is intented that this module does not create ready-to-use artworks from scratch.
     It can only happen, when you put in well made parameters (whith everything what makes a great artwork),
     that the mutation will keep many of those properties, making it a nice artwork.
     Or in short: the better your input, the better the output.

- Navigator-size may now be altered (you must expand the right toolbar to see the "Navigator size" control),
  the last setting is stored to the ini-file. Please note, that the size can only be defined in percent
  by using the arrows or listbox, but not by changing the window-size directly (this is due to some historic
  implementation details).

- Global rework of the UI, added theme-support, made "Glossy" the default theme,
  changed the captions of some buttons in order to make them more readable

- Formula-Window:
    - exchanging of formulas now works in two directions

- integrated formula-editor for creating/editing JIT-compiled formulas (see the new buttons in the formula window)
   - support for MB3D
         parameters and constants, both the TIteration3D and TIteration3Dext-structs are supported
   - preprocessor to deal with the parameter-handling code
   - backed by the commercial PaxCompiler
   - included support for about 50 mathematical functions
   - watch out for formulas with the prefix "JIT" for examples!
   - Please note that dIFS-formulas are not supported yet because they are invoked differently,
     but also this will be fixed in future releases

- Many new formulas from the community at fractalforums.com

- New Info-Section at the main window, which now has a button to reach the official bug-reporting tool,
  please use the bug-reporting-tool to report bugs if possible!

	 1  Fractal Software / Mandelbulb 3d / Re: Custom formulas & transforms - Release (Summary)

	IMPORTANT. HOW TO USE TRANSFORMS AS PRE-TRANSFORMS
	Jesse revealed me this trick that I didn't know. It is really really useful if you like to use transformations as pre-transformations.
	It is fundamental. Why?
	For example, the inversion of an inversion returns tre undeformed pixel ... So you will never want to do inversions more than once. 
	Apply the same Mobius transform twice will give another Mobius transform, but it is unwanted! This will cause a slowdown of the computation for nothing. (Note that I said "the same". Mobius conditional transforms are a completely different thing)
	The same applies for every possible coordinate transform (except for coord - scaling- inverse coord sequence that can give interesting effects, a "particular case").
	In this mode you can do (for example) a Mobius transformation only once. This will reduce a lot the DE disturbing effect, keeping the deformation effect at 100% of its strength.
	It is easy as drink water. Put the transform, or all the sequence of wanted transforms, at FIRST. Then put every formula that you like, after all the transforms.
	Now, go to the first formula (for example it's in tab named "Fo.2"). Check "Repeat from here".
	This allows you to calculate every IFS or Julia fractal in transformed coordinate mode.
	To do the same with Mset fractals, you need a complete coordinate inversion. For now only "SphereInvC" is a complete coordinate inversion. Expect more soon. 

	Example of a Julia set deformed by a loxodromic Mobius transform

	The archive contains those release (final) formulas;

	AbsX, AbsY, AbsZ, LogX, LogY, LogZ, Gnarl2D, Gnarl3D

	They will not be changed in the future (I really hope so! - at 99%) so you can use it in your important renders safely. 

	The other topic contains "untested" formulas - wips and unoptimized formulas. Use them BUT at your risk 

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	Revision 2.
	AbsX, AbsY, AbsZ, LogX, LogY, LogZ, Gnarl2D, Gnarl3D are left unchenged (fixed a typo in description of AbsY, thanks Jesse!). New transforms;

	tocylindrical, invcylindrical, sphereinv, helispiral

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	Revision 2.1
	Too bad sphereinv had an error in coding, so that instead of computing z/rho it computed rho/z... But I love the "wrong" effect that looks very promising, so now we have sphereXinv, sphereYinv, sphereZinv. sphereZinv is the old (wrong) sphereinv. I am terribly sorry for the inconvenient!  

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	Revision 3
	Added hyc3Dinv (hypercomplex 3D inversion).
	Based on tricomplex number theory. Info on tricomplex numbers here; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricomplex_number - very interesting stuff!

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	Revision 4
	Added poincare (Poincarè metric, base code is almost identical to sphere inversion but final look is quite different ).
	Fixed typos in some inversions; you may need to adjust "scale" to get the same result again.I don't honestly think that it can harm, nobody is using inversions for now I think 

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	Revision 4.5
	Fixed coding errors in Poincarè - now is no more fuzzy and seems to work OK 

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	Revision 5
	Added _tospherical and _invspherical (with correct code, works faster than the "test" version) plus a new tool for coordinate manipulation _Scalingplus 

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	Revision 5.5
	Fixed _invspherical bad coding, to avoid x-y flipping and make it work correctly with non-ifs formulas.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	Revision 6
	Added several toric geometry transforms. Have fun but they are not accurate... 

	6.5
	New torus inversion added (the third) - Inaccurate too but absolutely funny

	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	7.0
	Two completely new formulas featured in the collection; box tiling and Barnsley 4D. As I know, nobody ever tried to extend Barnsley in 4 dimensional space.

	7.5
	Added Barnsley 4D (non commutative). Uses standard Hamilton product and looks less strange than the commutative counterpart 

	7.6
	Added Barnsley2_4D in comm and non-comm versions, it is a simple tweak of the conditions.  

	7.7
	Added Lambda4D in comm and non-comm versions, it is another simple tweak.   FIXED error in a sign of commutative rule;

	( ... , Az Bx + Aw By + Ax ... ) is wrong and ( ... , Az Bx - Aw By + Ax ... ) is the correct term

	So Barnsleyc, Barnsley2c are corrected with the correct commutative rule as said in http://home.comcast.net/~cmdaven/hyprcplx.htm .

	8.0
	Added several attractor transforms. They can be used alone to generate attractor-like fractals of strange kinds.
	dynamic, cosmartin are from Mark Townsend. They use cos/sin functions and are a bit slow.
	Lorenz, Rabinovich-Fabrikant, Rossler systems are much faster because they are purely polynomial.

	8.5
	Van der Pol added. Many parameters. 
	8.55
	Van der Pol 2 added. Many parameters. 
	8.6
	Hopalong added, with two modified versions. 
	8.7
	KAM torus (with cutoff version) added. 
	8.8
	_HopSqrt for each 3D dimension added. 
	8.9
	_NeoSqr for each 3D dimension added. 
	9.0
	_Log4D and _Exp4D added. 
	10
	QuatPow added. 
	10.5
	Sin4Dplus added. 
	10.6
	Updated ("bug"fix)
	10.7
	Found in; http://bugman123.com/Hypercomplex/index.html new (but "old" ) formulas; added BristorBrot and MandyCousin. They look cool!
	10.8
	Another pearl from Bugman's site; Quadratic 3D Mandelbrot 
	10.9
	Another interesting transform is here. A Mobius 3D function, that uses White/Nylander theory; MobiusTpx (tpx = triplex) 
	11.0
	CubicQuat added. (Well, an approximation of it, but you can still get very nice results).
	11.1
	Ikenagabulb added. (see the notes for more info).
	11.2
	All possible conj formulas released. 
	11.3
	MengerKoch formula released. 
	11.4
	MengerKoch V2 formula released.In my opinion it's far better, more accurate and faithful to original Koch curve. But I keep also the old one, it's good for experiments. 
	11.5
	SierpHilbert formula released.Very easy: I applied the same transforms to Sierpinski3, to get a nice variation. Countless variations can be obtained.
	11.6
	Added Tanh4D. Comes with this disclaimer (for now, it's an useless function)... 
	*WARNING* - Too bad, this function is actually almost useless, even if the 2D slices
	look pretty. (Also, AFAIK, use it as a pre-transform is not a good idea.) Why?
	This is due to the "nature" of the function itself, because the function is numerically
	accurate (compared with UltraFractal's tanh, gives the same results for z=w=0 and default settings).
	tanh is convergent for "big" values of the argument, and convergent functions
	are NOT supported by Mandelbulb3D for now. (DE works for "divergent" fractals only).
	The only way to avoid this is setting low pre-muls and a high final mul.
	But this destroys the effect of the function itself - and leads to noisy images. Useless again!
	The only way to use it seems to be: use low bailouts. Same issues of the previous.
	I release it for experimental purposes or for future use only.
	11.7
	The formula _Sin4D plus (as I suspected) was wrong and needed fix.
	http://www.fractalforums.com/mandelbulb-3d/commutative-sign-error-plus-new-release/ <- here you will find the old version if you like.
	From now on, the database will contain the "real" sine in 4D following Hamilton theory.
	11.6
	Added Atan4D. Shares some troubles with Tanh, but less evident (surely it's due to the convergency: Atan converge asintotically to 1/x + ... while Tanh is e^(-x) + ... - really different).  
	12.
	Added MagVsXYZabs in 3 variations.Formula from M.Benesi tweaked... 
	12.1
	Added MagVsXYZ. But I am not very satisfied, since it is still different from Chaos Pro version (but it is more stable) - probably due to differences in DE? Or an invisible bug in formula? 
	12.2
	It seems that it is only a problem of viewpoint and destop, the formula is identical. Now added the magswitch variation
	If you really can't live without the ChaosPro viewpoint, try to use the parameter; http://www.fractalforums.com/theory/an-old-formula-revised/msg29695/#msg29695
	Then use Axiom2 = Axiom1^(3-Power)
	I think that with those tools you should get the same results as CP, if not the same at 90% similar. 
	12.3
	Added RuckerBrot1. This formula has the weird property that z is power 1 and x,y are power 2, but has a nice look so I included it 
	12.3
	Added RuckerBulb.  
	12.4
	Bugfixed and vastly improved RuckerBulb.  
	12.45
	Now RuckerBulb is turned to the left, like every other fractal. This allows you to create meaningful hybrids and not crappy ones! 
	I had to change some signs to force this, but it was necessary...
	12.5
	Added IQ-Bulb. I copied exactly the formula, but the result is odd. Maybe the formula he actually used is not the one he says. 
	13
	Added _CelticMode. This trasformation is extremely interesting and opens an immense field of exploration!
	Also, I added the new SphereInv with new "noise-free" mode enabled. The trasform is shown in 3D folder but it's not a trouble since it is really a 3D transformation! (Spheres are 3D objects ...)
	13.1
	Removed wrong de-option in MobiusTpx too. Works really better now. Added PolyFolding
	13.2
	Fixed PolyFolding, and added "Skew" parameter
	13.3
	Omg!!! Added the crazy wild Escher cubic 3D tessellation handle with care eheheh 
	13.4
	Another tessellation, Pytagora's tree 
	13.5
	Was in my todo list from a long time. Finally done _updateC 
	And added _flipC-xyz (if you are insane, use it at every iteration)
	13.6
	Looked again IQ-bulb. Changing some codes, I managed to remove discontinuities, now it looks better for even and odd powers. Don't know still if there are other mistakes in the code, but now it looks more good. 
	13.7
	Removed other mistakes in IQ bulb, now it looks very very different, correct I hope! 
	ps. Similar mistakes must be hidden in Ruckerbulb too, so it needs fixing too! Later 
	13.8
	Added JuliBrot mode and Mandel 4D BiComplex.Mainly for historical reasons, they are not so good compared with actual formulas ...But they were the first "3D formula" attempts ever 
	13.9
	Added Dragon curve tessellation and fixed Pytagoras tree.They work well in navi too (thanks Jesse)
	14.0
	More fixes and added variations to dragon tessellation. 
	15.0
	Merged Dragon and Pytagoras to IFS tessellation they are too much similar! 
	15.1
	Added _setw option for 4D fractals 
	15.2
	Added Magnet triplex fractal. Not so useful, but can give interesting plots 
	15.3
	Modified Magnet triplex: added some options, and fixed the annoying "z=0 bug". I left optional the bugfix, because the "wrong" formula gives beautiful results too, with some parameter twaeking 
	15.4
	Modified all Barnsley 4D. Fixed bad coding of conditional jump, and added angle options for Barnsley 1. This fix is very important because the formula seems to work REALLY better now, and the noise is 90% reduced! 
	15.5
	Added PG-bulb, from a formula from Pseudogenius http://www.fractalforums.com/3d-fractal-generation/a-different-3d-mandelbrot/
	I improved it slightly, so it allows you to choose an arbitrary power (in a reasonable range however)
	15.6
	Added _quadist - quadratic type distorsion in 3D
	15.6
	Added a Talis  3D formula (not so awesome but good enough)
	15.7
	Fixed a strange error ... SphereInv was missing the radius option (?) added again 
	15.8
	Under the "pressure" of a forum newbie, added his quat formula djd-quat 
	15.9
	REMOVED Djd quat since Jesse made a fairly better version. 
	16.0
	Updated Barnsley  4D formulas - now you can get also Tent maps. Both commutative and not are updated
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_map - It is not exactly like Wiki defines it - but I taken the formula from UF database. 
	16.5
	Added a new complex transform, that I called coordvspow - be sure to try it  
	16.6
	Added triplex exp() function to my new transform that can give a lot of particular bulbs (if wisely used!)
	16.7
	updated the transform as Jesse suggested (I tried)
	16.8
	HexaTransform from Aexion added! 
	16.9
	Update C updated for Spider fractals (added two multipliers) and corrected flip c-xyz (now it flips, and not simply moves. Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks Jesse for pointing out!)
	17
	Koch Cube added, after a painful search (see the thread http://www.fractalforums.com/3d-fractal-generation/3d-koch-snowflake-convert-to-escape-time/15/ )
	No rotations implemented for now
	17.1
	Koch Cube : more parameters added (still no rot available)
	17.2
	Koch Cube : more fixing, and rotations added
	17.3
	Koch Cube : when used with "addC", some cuts appeared, due to a minor error in signs - now no longer.Still problems when stretch is used, too bad! 
	17.4 (after a "long" time)
	_mulC3D - see the description. May be useful? Maybe! 
	17.5
	_mulC3D - was wrong (the y component), so I fixed and added many more options, now it can give so many new effects... You really need to try it I can't describe them, they are a completely new set of effects absolutely unobtainable before! 
	17.6
	_mulC3D - Added rotate options and the z multiplier. Now it's complete...
	17.7
	_sphereinv - Added option "Folding mode" - fantastic for customized sphere inversion fractals!!!
	17.8
	_sphereinv - Had a critical error that leaded to access violations, now fixed. Added another folding mode.
	17.85
	_sphereinv - Cleanup & optimized version, considerably faster now!
	17.9
	_helispiral - Added option "reference rotation". Old params should be manually modified but this variation is much more interesting than before
	17.95
	_helispiral - Added option "Refer to C". Even more variations possible now
	17.975 
	_helispiral - Added more options
	18.0
	_sphereinv - Added IRadius (for a non conformal spherical folding)
	18.5
	_sphereinv - Should be the last modification. Added the correct inversion "undo" and left the non conformal one (4 modes in total)
	18.6
	As some modes are almost pointless I removed them completely, leaving only the most stable ones.
	18.7
	_tetra3dfold that is useful for kifs experimenting- C version should come soon!
	_RotateXYonIts - Added my new functionality "reference rotation", so it's possible to rotate on its every possible plane (not only XY)
	18.8
	_tetra3dfold renamed to _FoldingTetra3d (according to Jesse's naming convention), also added _FoldingCTetra3d now! Many effects are possible with existing formulas.
	18.9
	Riemann2 added, with many many user params.
	19.0
	ABoxVS_icen added; allows to get new ABox variations, as you vary the inversion center; C-Swap mode is completely new, though! (idea inspired form Mandelbulber)
	19.1
	ABoxVS_icen1, ABoxVS_icen2 - Added another mode (the existing is tagged as "2")
	19.2
	ABoxMod1 released (from Kali's formula but a bit modified)
	19.3
	ABoxMod1 updated
	19.35
	FoldingInfy added - thanks dwsel for the ideas!
	19.4
	ABoxMod1 - fixed negative values for folding modifications
	19.5
	Several modifications & some new formulas released. Most important, Amazing tetrahedral fractal 
	19.51
	ATetraVS - fixed a dumb dumb coding error. Now formula is ok as I intended originally!
	19.52
	ATetraVS - Modified the default parameters, because I think that those new ones are much more promising!
	19.6
	TetraFolding Pow2 added
	19.7
	Added two new transforms, one for a double julia seed and one for a ripple effect
	19.8
	Added a smooth ABox, like Buddhi's one but with a much simpler formula. Looks cool, I'm curious to see some renders anyway 
	19.9
	Now the smooth abox has a smooth r folding too. The formula is quite complicated I must say but it works like a charm!
	20.0
	Added functionality to last fmla...
	20.1
	Fixed bug when minr tends to 1. Cleanup for speed 
	20.2
	More accurate smoothing selection for ballfold. A new formula, with arbitrary double rpow selection, very slow 
	20.3
	Added a "radial" version of Partly Julia (by Jesse of course) 
	Added a second multiplier for TetraFoldPow2 too. (I did this long ago, but forgot to update) 
	20.4
	Error in PartlyJulia. xCenter modified z coordinate instead (and zC -> x), now fixed!
	Added a recenter option (not perfectly working though)
	20.5
	Fixed the recenter option (had to rewrite a big section of the code but it was needed)...
	20.6
	Added a control box to choose different cutting shapes (!!!)
	20.7
	Even more cutting shapes added!
	20.8
	Added a new ABox from Aexion! Try it, looks so stylish!
	20.9
	I had an idea for two new pretransforms in torical coords sitting in the folder. Finally done, totorical2 and invtorical2, yayz
	21.0
	Added ABoxVSShapes, that for now supports Torus, Cylinder and Cone as "base shapes". More soon hopefully 
	21.1
	Added ConeB, that is same as old cone. So in your params replace shapemod 4 with 5 to render correctly! ConeA is a new formula
	21.2
	Added lots of shapes (final version?)
	21.3
	Added new version of cone + paraboloid
	21.4
	Added more shapes (now they are 16) 
	21.5
	IMPORTANT notice. Corrected PG-Bulb as it was wrong and potentially dangerous. Now if you choose wrong not in range int-powers it autofixes avoiding lockups. For Jesse; don't include the old formula in the new database please! 
	Also added a "new" quat-like thing
	21.6
	Added hyperMenger
	21.7
	bugfix for hyperMenger now accurate DE and formula!!! 
	21.8
	bugfix for hyperMenger - xinv and yinv had to be swapped to get the same effect of sphereinv then menger
	21.9
	NEW OPTIONS for hyperMenger +2 
	21.95
	hyperMenger chaged the default parameter for an example image with "kissing" spheres 
	22.0
	_DonutTransform a yummy idea from Aexion
	22.1
	Added a shape to ABoxVsShapes (n° 17)
	22.2
	_RotateXYonItsP 
	22.3
	Faehrten (imported from Gestaltlupe) 
	22.4
	_skew added 
	22.5
	MengerIFSplus added(modifies the rotation center)
	Sierpinski3alt added(modifies the rotation center)
	22.4
	Sierpinski4 addedand big thanks to Syntopia who invented it! 
	22.5
	Menger4 added- again thanks to Syntopia, because the formula shares a lot with Sierpinski4. Clarified the "3d vs 4d" bug and signaled in formula notes (thanks Jesse).
	22.6
	Octahedron4 added(modified version of Sierpinski, a quick hack)
	22.7
	MixPinski4 added(modified version of Sierpinski mixed with Menger)
	22.8
	HalfOct4a and HalfOct4b added(modified version of Sierpinski octahedron, with different symmetry planes)
	22.9
	ATetraVS2 added . This works great unlike the overly complicated cousin
	23.0
	Corrected MengerIFS plus

	24.1
	Corrected a mistake in coding IQ-bulb, so it looks much more consistent with the "original",kept the old one but renamed
	24.2
	General; generalization and unification of all (or almost all) the possible bulb funcs in just one formula. Phew! This was NOT not easy but wow, a bunch of crazy things are possible now!!!
	24.25
	General; Adjusted, because 'recipe 2' did not take into account 'zmul' 
	24.28
	Added to my collection _QuadrayTransform2.m3f - Jesse forgot to include it in latest release and it just disappeared from the whole internet so here it is now!Thanks to Lenord for giving it back! ( I lost it too!   )
	24.3

	25.0
	GenCWarp fixed a bug: now value 0 for Theta-Args is correctly handled. (No more glitches. You will still see glitches if you try to choose a value out of range, and it will not be fixed btw )
	_DEComb_ISph_Plane added
	25.1
	OctKoch added (uncertain about something. but it's flexible so I added btw)
	25.2

	Changed default scale to 2.63 - some details look way better
	25.3
	Faster version by Blob added (hack from Jesse's Icosa)
	25.4
	ManowarBulb added- requires SSE2 but it only uses the register for storing, it's a bit slow because it does a float exponentiation btw
	25.5
	GnarlyIFS added - requires SSE2 too because it's derived from waveIFS...
	25.6
	DucksIFS added - requires SSE2 too because it's derived from waveIFS... And it's very slow, because it needs many iterations and a complicated magnitude evaluation to show up a good detail level.
	25.7
	Some useless stuff added... Sorry...Another Beth thingy and a variant of quat
	25.8
	Amazing Surf added. (by Kali) implemented by me of course

	28.0
	Removed Citrus for now (it is very buggy... I will replace it with a similar thingy) but added Devil (devil =   )and bugfixed Mitre (produced some unwanted "spaghetti" on high itersnow they are a lot thinner so they will not disturb)
	28.1
	Added some surfaces. But they cause bugs on high iters; Limpet
	DecoCube fixed, plus some bonus wavesp, weirdcube, toupie (it seems to work on higher iters)

	29.4
	_CondLyapunov added 
	29.5
	A full set of itercount modifiers added. They are of two kinds.

	The itercount of the formulas is modified following a binary string rule. The itercount will be set 0 / 1 in simple Lyapunov switch or to two different values in the general Lyapunov.
	Generic switch;
	More advanced.
	The itercount will be set to three different values according to a critical iteration value. This can give very unique fractal shapes. It is not easy to explain here... But believe me 
	3 formulas added 
	29.6
	Fixed _sphereinv for the n-th time again to avoid navi issues 
	30.0
	Extra formula; ABoxMod2!

	33.2
	koch_oct added 
	33.3
